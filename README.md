# scheduler

This program was created by Weston McKay, you can contact me at mckayweston@csu.fullerton.edu.

To run the scheduler first input the times the 2 people you are comparing are already busy as well as the total time throughout the day they are willing to act into the input text file. These inputs should be in military time and maintain the same format as the sample inputs. There should also be a total meeting time, which should be input in minutes (for example 1 hour 30 minutes would be input as 90.) After that execute scheduler.exe and all outputs will be printed to Output.txt.
